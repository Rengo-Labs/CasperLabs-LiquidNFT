### Requirements

1. Install the [rust environment and casper client](https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/.dapp-dev-guide/setup-of-rust-contract-sdk.html)

2. Install [wasm-strip](https://command-not-found.com/wasm-strip)

3. Clone this repo and navigate into the folder.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Rengo-Labs-official/CasperLabs-LiquidNFT.git
```

4. A receiving Casper account. An easy way to set one up is using the [Casperlabs Signer](https://docs.cspr.community/docs/user-guides/SignerGuide.html).

### Install the prerequisites

You can install the required software by issuing the following commands. If you are on an up-to-date Casper node, you probably already have all of the prerequisites installed so you can skip this step.

#### Note: If any command fails try again by restarting the terminal to reset the enviornment variable.

```bash
# Update package repositories
sudo apt update
# Install the command-line JSON processor
sudo apt install jq -y
# Install rust
# Choose cutomize intallation to install nightly version
# Install the nightly version (by default stable toolchain is installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install nightly
# Check that nightly toolchain version is installed(this will list stable and nightly versions)
rustup toolchain list
# Set rust nightly as default
rustup default nightly
# Install wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
# Rust Version
rustup --version
# Install Cmake
sudo apt-get -y install cmake
Note:https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html
# cmake Version
cmake --version
# Installing the Casper Crates
cargo install cargo-casper
# Add Casper repository
echo "deb https://repo.casperlabs.io/releases" bionic main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/casper.list
curl -O https://repo.casperlabs.io/casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt-key add casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config
# Install the Casper client software
cargo +nightly install casper-client
# To check Casper Client Version
casper-client --version
# Commands for help
casper-client --help
casper-client <command> --help
```

### Creating Keys

#### Note: Choose the name of directory where generated keys will be stored.

```bash
# Create keys
casper-client keygen <TARGET DIRECTORY>
```

### Usage

To run the Contracts make sure you are in the root folder.

#### Note

Make sure `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is installed.

```
make prepare
```

#### Run All Smart Contracts And Generate Keys

Run this command to build all smart contract and generate keys.

```
make all
```

#### Test All Smart Contracts

Run this command to build and test all smart contracts.

```
make test-all
```

#Alternatively you can build and test individual contracts

It's also recommended to have [wasm-strip](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
available in your PATH to reduce the size of compiled Wasm.

#### Build individual Smart Contract

You can run this commands to build individual smart contracts.

```
make build-contract-liquid-factory
make build-contract-liquid-locker
```

### Note: High processing power is required to run test cases otherwise you may face errors like

```
error: test failed
Caused by: process didn't exit successfully: `/home/.../.../ (signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill)
```

#### Test individual Smart Contract

You can run this commands to test individual smart contracts.

```
make test-liquid-factory
```

# Interacting with onchain contracts (the easy way)

A host of scripts have been made available in the package.json file. They simplify the task of running cumbersome manual commands. Make sure your in folder with package.json then run any script by

```
npm run <script_name> <param_one> <param_two> .....
```

### Deploying Liquid Factory contract manually

If you need to deploy the `Liquid Factory` contract manually you need to pass some parameters. Following is the command to deploy the `Liquid Factory contract`.

```bash
sudo casper-client put-deploy \
    --chain-name chain_name \
    --node-address http://$NODE_ADDRESS:7777/ \
    --secret-key path_to_secret_key.pem \
    --session-path path_to_wasm_file \
    --payment-amount 10000000000 \
    --session-arg="public_key:public_key='Public Key In Hex'" \
    --session-arg="default_token:Key='default_token address'"
    --session-arg="trustee_multisig:Key='trustee_multisig address'"
    --session-arg="contract_name:string='contract_name'"
```

A successful response will look like:

```json
{
  "api_version": "1.0.0",
  "deploy_hash": "8c3068850354c2788c1664ac6a275ee575c8823676b4308851b7b3e1fe4e3dcc"
}
```

Once the network has received the deployment, it will queue up in the system before being listed in a block for execution. Sending a transaction (deployment) to the network does not mean that the transaction processed successfully. Therefore, itâ€™s important to check to see that the contract executed properly, and that the block was finalized.

```bash
$ casper-client get-deploy --node-address http://<HOST:PORT> <DEPLOY_HASH>
```

Depending on your preference, it may be more convenient to just go to the cspr.live block explorer though after a minute or so:

```
https://testnet.cspr.live/deploy/<DEPLOY_HASH>
```
