### Install the prerequisites

You can install the required software by issuing the following commands. If you are on an up-to-date Casper node, you probably already have all of the prerequisites installed so you can skip this step.

```bash
# Update package repositories
sudo apt update
# Install the command-line JSON processor
sudo apt install jq -y
# Install rust
# Choose cutomize intallation to install nightly version
# Install the nightly version (by default stable toolchain is installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install nightly
# Check that nightly toolchain version is installed(this will list stable and nightly versions)
rustup toolchain list
# Set rust nightly as default
rustup default nightly
# Install wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
# Rust Version
rustup --version
# Install Cmake
sudo apt-get -y install cmake
Note:https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html
# cmake Version
cmake --version
# Installing the Casper Crates
cargo install cargo-casper
# Add Casper repository
echo "deb https://repo.casperlabs.io/releases" bionic main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/casper.list
curl -O https://repo.casperlabs.io/casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt-key add casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config
# Install the Casper client software
cargo +nightly install casper-client
# To check Casper Client Version
casper-client --version
# Commands for help
casper-client --help
casper-client <command> --help
```

### Creating Keys

```bash
# Create keys
casper-client keygen <TARGET DIRECTORY>
```

### Usage

To run the Contracts make sure you are in the root folder.

#### Install

Make sure `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is installed.

```
make prepare
```

It's also recommended to have [wasm-strip](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
available in your PATH to reduce the size of compiled Wasm.

#### Build individual Smart Contract

You can run this commands to build individual smart contracts.

```
make build-contract-liquid-helper
make build-contract-liquid-locker
```

#### Test individual Smart Contract

You can run this commands to build individual smart contracts.

```
make test-liquid-helper
make test-liquid-locker
```

#### Run ALL Smart Contracts

Run this command to build & test all smart contract.

```
make all
```

### Deploying Liquid Helper contract manually

If you need to deploy the `Liquid Helper` contract manually you need to pass some parameters. Following is the command to deploy the `Liquidity Helper contract`.

```bash
sudo casper-client put-deploy \
    --chain-name chain_name \
    --node-address http://$NODE_ADDRESS:7777/ \
    --secret-key path_to_secret_key.pem \
    --session-path path_to_wasm_file \
    --payment-amount 10000000000 \
    --session-arg="public_key:public_key='Public Key In Hex'" \
    --session-arg="contract_name:string='contract_name'"
```
